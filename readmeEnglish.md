## Project for Reducing Student Dropout Rates in STEM Fields

This project aims to develop a Learning Management System (LMS) with functionalities designed to reduce student dropout rates in STEM fields among the population aged 17-35 in higher education.

## Scope and Functionalities

### Free Education

We offer free courses to enable students to improve their academic performance and excel in their studies.

### Alert for Possible Dropout

We implement an alert system that analyzes students' academic performance and sends notifications to teachers and psychologists if a risk of dropout is detected. This allows for initiating follow-ups and providing the necessary assistance to prevent dropout.

### Psychological Support

We provide a space where students facing personal problems can contact professionals who will help them resolve their difficulties.

### Mentorship

Students with outstanding performance have the opportunity to apply for mentorship, where they can teach other interested students.
